Overview

Computer usage has always been typical, although easy, nowadays in this modern digital time, the usage is very competitive as various works are done simultaneously and for productivity works the only things that matter are skills and time. Skills improve by practicing and practicing but there is no alternative for time reduction apart from improving speed which once again develops with skills. We have developed simple but efficient computer programmers for time efficiency in their productivity works for both professionals and amateurs.

Goals
1. To design a tailor-made assistance program for users according to their usage for their systems.
2. To implement all the fundamental programming concepts and skills that we have learned and developed in this current academic year.

Specifications Operating Systems:
This program has been written exclusively for Windows Operating Systems (Windows 7/8/10). Although this program can also be implemented in Linux Distros (Ubuntu, Debian, Red-Hat etc.) and MacOS (Sierra, Catalina, Big Sur etc.) although not every function can be accessible but the important and main functions would be still usable.
But still for best user experience, Windows 10 is highly recommended.

Development Environment:
This program is fundamentally written in Python Language and hence, any version of Python 3 (Python 3.6/Python 3.8/Python 3.9 etc.) is necessary for execution of this program.
Also, MySQL Community Version software is needed for maintaining a database and hence MySQL software is also required for the same.

Note : You have to install some python packages which you can find from requirements.txt, for weather and news you have to create your own API key from;
